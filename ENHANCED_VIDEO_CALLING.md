### Audio System
```javascript
// Ringtone with fallback
ringtoneRef.current = new Audio();
ringtoneRef.current.src = '/ringtone.mp3';
ringtoneRef.current.onerror = () => {
  // Fallback to Web Audio API beep
};
```

### Signal Transfer
```javascript
// Enhanced peer configuration
const newPeer = new Peer({
  initiator: true,
  trickle: true, // Enable ICE trickling
  stream: localStream,
  config: {
    iceServers: [
      { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
      { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' }
    ]
  }
});
```

## Usage
